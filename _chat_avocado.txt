[27.04.22, 12:07:33] David: Thank you!
[27.04.22, 12:08:05] David: Would you guys feel like bringing your painting equipment today? Feels like it could suit well to the bookclub conversation
[27.04.22, 12:14:20] Maschi Hofbauer: Book club is next week, right? 😅
[27.04.22, 12:14:34] Maschi Hofbauer: First week of the month

[03.05.22, 12:52:42] Kochanie Kas: Nice! Maschi if you could bring your wasches…..
[04.05.22, 09:27:53] Maschi Hofbauer: Will do!
[04.05.22, 09:28:26] Maschi Hofbauer: It's so strange not to meet tonight 😅 what time tomorrow?
[04.05.22, 09:28:33] David: This will be awesome
[04.05.22, 09:29:34] David: Let’s do 18:30 so I have to close the pc at some point. Otherwise I see myself continuing until the last second before you guys come again.
[04.05.22, 09:36:33] Flora Cantagrel: Would it be possible for me to come at 6? You don’t have to talk to me I‘m happy to walk Franio or just sit and read till 6:30 but I have Uni till 5 and it would be great to come afterwards otherwise I just have half an hour more of commuting.
[04.05.22, 10:00:36] Kochanie Kas: Sure, all works well for me
[04.05.22, 10:21:49] Flora Cantagrel: I can also spend the time to make some food if we want to eat something together?
[04.05.22, 10:26:47] Kochanie Kas: Whatever flows your boat!!!!

[04.05.22, 11:46:17] Kochanie Kas: I have another cabbage batch so we could use it too 😅 but really whatever you feel like
[05.05.22, 22:36:11] Kochanie Kas: Flora, our bus leaves at 17 from sudkreutz so we’ll need to leave 16:10 latest I guess, so sorry and it’s ok if you can’t make it that early, as we spoke! ✨🌖
[06.05.22, 07:39:23] Flora Cantagrel: No problem 💫💛
[06.05.22, 10:46:10] Kochanie Kas: Thank you!
[06.05.22, 10:47:31] Kochanie Kas: Guys, I forgot to ask yesterday, will you be coming to Dębina on Thursday before the wedding? It would be great to know if this still stands so we can book accordingly ☺️
[07.05.22, 08:23:18] Flora Cantagrel: I would love to, I think it’s up to Maschi to organize his absence from the school…
[07.05.22, 09:51:08] Kochanie Kas: Ok, so waiting for Maschi to let us know. Arriving Thursday late afternoon/early evening would be just fantastic!
[07.05.22, 09:52:31] Flora Cantagrel: I think that should be possible as he has to take off Friday anyways :)
[07.05.22, 10:17:03] Maschi Hofbauer: Yes, yes. I hesitate because of my German sense of duty, I guess. But I can of course pretend to be sick one day earlier 😅 
Let's do it!!
[07.05.22, 10:21:56] Flora Cantagrel: Wonderful 💕
[07.05.22, 10:43:30] Kochanie Kas: Hope the sickness is not too serious! And great!!!
[09.05.22, 12:06:16] Flora Cantagrel: Hey Dave, can you tell me your bookclub pick again, please?
[09.05.22, 12:06:44] David: Cixin liu - the three body problem
[09.05.22, 12:19:41] Flora Cantagrel: Thanks
[10.05.22, 14:15:45] Kochanie Kas: Hey lovely friends! I’ll be for sure ordering from Hero Forge soon as I’m running out of minis…. Let me know if you would like to share the shipment☺️
[10.05.22, 17:07:31] Flora Cantagrel: Cool thanks!! 😏
[11.05.22, 17:09:24] Kochanie Kas: Maschi, would you mind bringing tomorrow, if you have, gold and silver airbrushes?

[12.05.22, 16:41:51] David: I would be down for a Halumi and kas would be down for a Makali
[12.05.22, 16:42:13] David: Scratch that I could go for a falafel sorry
[12.05.22, 16:49:16] Maschi Hofbauer: Will bring!

[13.05.22, 15:59:07] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys, Maschi and I are going to a concert next Thursday, so we would have to move our session back to Wednesday if that’s possible?

[23.05.22, 13:24:22] Maschi Hofbauer: dare I ask... 18:00? 🙈
[23.05.22, 13:28:24] David: Nah maschi, last time it was barely manageable at 7 and this week that’s the last day of the week for many so for sure it will be long.
[23.05.22, 13:30:34] Maschi Hofbauer: All good. 😊 I'm just gonna keep asking because we play less than two hours at the moment. But no worries if you can't make 6 work! See you at 7 then :)
[23.05.22, 13:32:54] David: I feel ya, hopefully Thursday will change this for good in the future
[23.05.22, 13:35:42] Maschi Hofbauer: let's see! so far Thursday seems actually more unreliable, right? 🤔

[27.05.22, 08:44:19] Maschi Hofbauer: The weekend 4th/5th is totally busy for you guys? How about the public holiday on Monday 6th?
[27.05.22, 09:54:52] Kochanie Kas: Yes, unfortunately we are out 4-6.06
[27.05.22, 09:57:01] Maschi Hofbauer: yes, that's what I thought! well then we'll just have a little celebration on the 9th :)
[27.05.22, 10:36:37] Kochanie Kas: Sorry! Would have been splendid! We can have some small celebration then too 🥂
[30.05.22, 12:35:42] Kochanie Kas: Hey guys, it sucks but we cannot play on Thursday next week so again trying Wednesday? 8th? So sorry it just came up today.
[30.05.22, 12:40:52] Flora Cantagrel: I can’t to the 8th unfortunately :/ I have very little wiggle room in my schedule for the upcoming weeks unfortunately 😔 sorry!
[30.05.22, 12:43:22] Kochanie Kas: Ok, I’ll see what I can do on our end
[30.05.22, 12:45:46] Maschi Hofbauer: I'm not convinced of this Thursday schedule... 🤔
[30.05.22, 14:04:06] Kochanie Kas: I think it’s just a very busy time, unfortunately.
[30.05.22, 14:04:27] Kochanie Kas: But will keep you posted!
[31.05.22, 08:28:04] Kochanie Kas: Ok, we can stay with 9th.
[31.05.22, 08:33:08] Flora Cantagrel: Amazing thank you!!!!!

[04.06.22, 12:45:49] Maschi Hofbauer: Guys. I notice there's no Dresscode indicated on the invitation. Is it more black tie smoking or more like summer wedding linen suit time? I don't wanna stick out!! 😬
[04.06.22, 12:52:13] David: I think it’s up to you what tone you like for a wedding. But it’s definitely a summer wedding without any hard requirements for dress code. I will be wearing the nicest suit I ever owned but it’s not like the most possible formal suit. My take on fancy dress codes is almost always to play with the fanciness of it all. Either way I don’t think you need to worry about sticking out, the dress code won’t be very homogeneous anyways and that’s on purpose at least in my point of view. 
TLDR 
Dress what you feel comfortable in.
[04.06.22, 12:53:42] Maschi Hofbauer: That's only marginally helpful but thanks 😅 I'm figuring it out.. but black tuxedo seems a little like suicide in July.. 😅
[05.06.22, 23:47:22] Kochanie Kas: Tux is also a bit overdressed but my family for sure will be in suits (guys) and quite festive outfits for ladies too. In Poland wedding is one of the fancy moments but as David said we do want ppl to feel comfortable. Does this help Maschi?
[06.06.22, 06:56:15] Maschi Hofbauer: Yes, thanks! I've gotta look the part, you know 😅
[09.06.22, 16:43:01] Maschi Hofbauer: What time tonight? 6 or 7?
[09.06.22, 16:50:12] David: 7 would be great

Could we do Wednesday instead?

[12.06.22, 12:49:16] Flora Cantagrel: That’s ok! Do you think there will be another opportunity to watch it together?
[12.06.22, 12:56:15] Kochanie Kas: How about watching in 3?
[12.06.22, 12:58:45] Flora Cantagrel: Do you mean the three of us?
[12.06.22, 12:59:54] Kochanie Kas: Yes, it might be very tough for David to squeeze more in before the wedding and then we are gone for 2 weeks
[12.06.22, 13:00:58] Flora Cantagrel: Yes that’s what I thought! So yes to watching it anyway :)
[12.06.22, 17:44:22] Maschi Hofbauer: Do you wanna come here or should we come to you?
[12.06.22, 17:53:39] Kochanie Kas: I think it would be easier me coming over

[14.06.22, 09:56:08] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys, how does it look next week are we playing Wednesday or Thursday?
[14.06.22, 10:11:08] Kochanie Kas: I think Thursday, at least we do not have to move the regular
[14.06.22, 10:19:37] Flora Cantagrel: Ok cool
[15.06.22, 16:55:52] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey friends, when is the dinner scheduled to start on Thursday before the wedding? So when should we be there at the latest?
[15.06.22, 18:02:21] Kochanie Kas: 5 pm would suit the best for Magda and the baby shenanigans
[15.06.22, 23:08:34] Kochanie Kas: Hey! If 5pm is not suitable for the whole group we can arrange the food later! No problem!

[16.06.22, 14:37:08] Kochanie Kas: Tbh I’m not sure 🤔 personally I would rather have 2-2.5 full play time without a break than having the tiny one in place but it’s just my personal opinion. And it was thought for me to get into the game in general yesterday.
[16.06.22, 15:51:00] Maschi Hofbauer: Oh interesting! So I for sure need some kind of break after 1-1.5h 🙄
[16.06.22, 23:45:37] Kochanie Kas: Yea, of course we shall always do breaks if anyone needs one, that’s out of a question. 
It’s hard for me to switch from one mindset to other within 5-10 minutes but I’m having general attention issues as you might have realized/seen.

[17.06.22, 14:15:35] Kochanie Kas: Yes!
[18.06.22, 07:36:54] Flora Cantagrel: And to this topic I have to say that my position is similar to kas! This kind of short break doesn’t really do anything for me but obviously it’s no problem having it to whom ever needs it. And just as a side node because I felt Inonly asked stupid questions on Wednesday, I was also a bit out of it mentally 👀
[18.06.22, 17:24:23] David: I actually somewhat enjoyed it, the shorter break that is. I don’t know it helped to just go to the bathroom without rushing and refreshing drinks. 
I feel like there is a place for these kind of breaks, at least for me.
[23.06.22, 09:51:22] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey friends, I'm excited for the Towers of Night later 😬 what time can we start? 18, 18:30, 19?

[26.06.22, 11:59:15] David: Hey guys, 
Kas and I were chatting about the special editions of our campaign that we will prepare. During the conversation, we figured it would probably be useful to know the characters and their ability level in a little more detail. 
How do you guys feel about starting by designing our own sorcerer first? We thought along the lines of 2 limitations only and the rest is up to everyone themselves: 1. Level 10 character; 2. all ten levels are sorcerer levels.
[26.06.22, 11:59:39] David: Perhaps Maschi you want to add a limitation on which sources can be used so that we don't break the rules of your world?
[26.06.22, 11:59:53] David: What do you think about starting by creating the characters we play?
[26.06.22, 12:04:32] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey, I'm loving the excitement for this idea! I would add the source restriction: Only content from the Player's Handbook, Xanathar's, and Tasha's are allowed (that includes spells, which DNDBeyond does not filter, so be sure to check the source of the spells you're picking up).
I would also say that being 10th level, every character can spend 600gp on normal non-magical equipment (plus starting equipment) and gets to pick one uncommon magic item.
How does that sound?
[26.06.22, 12:04:58] David: great I think
[26.06.22, 12:05:36] Maschi Hofbauer: I think adventure-wise it shouldn't really make a difference whether we go character first or adventure first.. The challenge shouldn't conform to character abilities, but be an independently designed challenge, right?
[26.06.22, 12:06:29] David: yeah it will be, I felt like it was easier to grasp what  general power level we are working with once we have concrete character sheets but it's not a must either for me
[26.06.22, 12:07:39] Maschi Hofbauer: for combat you can use the DNDBeyond Encounter Builder https://www.dndbeyond.com/encounter-builder to get a rough gauge of what might kill the characters..
[26.06.22, 12:09:19] Kochanie Kas: For me it would be great to know at least subclasses you are interested in I or decided on. Of course for encounters we can use the builder but I need this I info more for the flair and encounter feel
[26.06.22, 12:10:25] Maschi Hofbauer: Then maybe it's enough if we just say our preferred subclasses here? Mine is probably Clockwork Soul. 😊
[26.06.22, 12:13:20] David: I'm tending towards a Wild Magic based character
[26.06.22, 12:19:10] David: so no races from volos?
[26.06.22, 12:19:42] David: nor the tortle package?
[26.06.22, 12:21:06] Maschi Hofbauer: Volo's and Mordenkainens are outdated since the release of "Monsters of the Multiverse". And none of us have access to that book on DNDBeyond..
[26.06.22, 12:21:25] David: I have the tortle package
[26.06.22, 12:21:52] Maschi Hofbauer: I'd say stick with PHB+Tasha's but if you wanna make a tortle I don't mind 😊
[26.06.22, 12:23:14] David: okay I'll find something cool from there, the tortle is just a really awesome flavour class in general I think. I need to check what happened to it after the update, but for the oneshot its a fun restriction that I'll adhere to!
[26.06.22, 12:26:32] David: variant human yes or no?
[26.06.22, 12:30:42] Maschi Hofbauer: of course! It's in the book!
[26.06.22, 12:30:58] David: cool
[26.06.22, 12:48:29] Kochanie Kas: I am eying Divine Soul
[26.06.22, 13:14:38] David: standard array, point buy or rolled stats?
[26.06.22, 13:14:48] Maschi Hofbauer: point buy!
[26.06.22, 13:14:51] Maschi Hofbauer: or standard
[26.06.22, 13:14:59] Maschi Hofbauer: individual choice
[30.06.22, 12:39:26] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys, we are on the road! Hope everything is going well on your end! See you this afternoon 🌸
[30.06.22, 12:39:57] David: Uh awesome travel safely you wonderful ones!
[30.06.22, 15:35:54] David: Hey peops
[30.06.22, 15:36:16] Flora Cantagrel: Just arrived!
[30.06.22, 15:39:21] Flora Cantagrel: I didn’t want to interrupt you 😅
[30.06.22, 15:40:00] David: We are on the way, just tried to call you maschi and mom and couldn’t reach anyone :D
[30.06.22, 15:40:30] David: Just wanted to let you know that they have the names and should be able to give you your keys for the rooms
[30.06.22, 15:40:42] David: Eta 20 minutes
[30.06.22, 15:45:08] Flora Cantagrel: 👍
[30.06.22, 16:09:43] David: We also arrived
[01.07.22, 10:45:25] Kochanie Kas: Hey! Agnieszka says no help needed now cause we will do outside setup last due to possible weather changes.
[01.07.22, 10:45:37] Kochanie Kas: I can’t still open the second speech.
[02.07.22, 11:23:12] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys, we had to stop on the red light can you send us the address?
[02.07.22, 11:23:41] David: We are waiting you will see us
[02.07.22, 11:23:46] David: Brzozowa 3
[02.07.22, 11:23:47] Flora Cantagrel: Ok perf
[02.07.22, 11:23:49] Flora Cantagrel: Thanks
[02.07.22, 21:47:12] Flora Cantagrel: GUYS! What an incredible, perfect wedding that was!! 😍🤵🏼‍♀️🤵🏽‍♂️😍 Thank you thank you thank you for creating such a wonderful celebration of love 🥰❤️
[02.07.22, 21:52:06] Flora Cantagrel: ‎Flora Cantagrel changed the subject to “Avocado Berlin 🍾🤵🏼‍♀️🤵🏽‍♂️❤️”
[02.07.22, 21:54:37] David: ❤️✖️♾
[03.07.22, 15:17:59] Flora Cantagrel: Heyy, hope you have a safe travel back home! We would love to drop off the tree later, do you know when you’ll be back?
[03.07.22, 16:56:00] Kochanie Kas: Would around 21 be ok?
[03.07.22, 17:08:45] Flora Cantagrel: We have to bring the car back around 6 unfortunately. But we could also leave the tree in front of your door if your are getting home not too long after that?
[03.07.22, 18:30:57] Kochanie Kas: Thank you friends! The tree is beautiful and it’s so fitting to the wedding vibe! 🌳 We are incredibly touched ♥️ many tears were shed 🥹 we love you to the moon and back and are very grateful that we all are the chosen family! 🥰
[03.07.22, 23:22:51] Flora Cantagrel: We are so glad you like it 🥰 It really felt like the right words were difficult to find so it seemed fitting to lend us some. The tree needs light but not necessarily direct sun light and a bit of water about once a week 🌳 Have a wonderful holiday my loves can’t wait to see you again ❤️
[04.07.22, 00:01:41] Kochanie Kas: Małgorzata i Mieczysław Rotniccy
Ul. Brzozowa 3
64-500 Szamotuły
[04.07.22, 08:34:27] Maschi Hofbauer: Wonderful, thank you. Have a safe journey!
[04.07.22, 09:55:55] David: Hey sweet chosen ones,
I was so tired yesterday that I didn’t really have it in me to write my emotions down. I still struggle with finding words for how much all of your unbelievable kindness during the last days and the past 20 years means to me. I love both of you very much and cannot wait for some new normality to be enjoyed by us together once we are back from the honeymoon! 
The tree made me cry multiple times and one quote will permanently live on framed in my room, with the rest staying on the tree, proudly displayed in dnd central (living room) 
Much love and gratitude 🙏♥️
[04.07.22, 09:56:53] David: For some fun flavor here are two of my favorite midnight shots:

[04.07.22, 23:03:42] Flora Cantagrel: I‘m so happy because it seems like the tree could kinda convey the emotional whirlwind and the struggle of putting it into words that I felt leading up to the wedding in regards to expressing what you guys mean to me. Can’t wait to have you back soon! But first I wish you a wonderful time on your honeymoon, you look so cute!!! Any pictures are much appreciated 😍
[04.07.22, 23:04:20] Flora Cantagrel: Haha my face is so read
[04.07.22, 23:04:35] Flora Cantagrel: But amazing that you took it!
[04.07.22, 23:05:54] David: It felt almost like sneaking in on a very special moment 😅 but I’m glad I did it, too!
[04.07.22, 23:10:05] David: Gotta go plane mode, see you soon! 🛫

[06.07.22, 07:53:28] Flora Cantagrel: and I know you talked about a different email adress, is it already active?
[06.07.22, 07:53:54] Flora Cantagrel: the festival tickets are personalized thats why I'm asking 🤗
[06.07.22, 08:00:03] Kochanie Kas: Yes, we wre still waiting for the embassy to do the paper work
[06.07.22, 08:00:36] Flora Cantagrel: Do you think they will get it done by the end of july?
[06.07.22, 08:01:48] Kochanie Kas: And he’ll get some paper confirming the change, right @4915229405643? So you can also show this as a proof. Plus I think the new name passport or ID won’t be ready in 3 weeks or less
[06.07.22, 08:04:34] Flora Cantagrel: yaaay got the tickets! 🤗

[06.07.22, 21:02:17] Kochanie Kas: Yes! And trying to remember how to sleep in a not vertical position 😅
[07.07.22, 09:02:29] Flora Cantagrel: Oh gosh 😳🫣
[07.07.22, 09:02:38] Flora Cantagrel: Hope you got some restful sleep!
[07.07.22, 09:02:52] Flora Cantagrel: Ah damn unfortunately I put your old one in
[07.07.22, 09:39:51] Maschi Hofbauer: Morning Mr. and Mrs. Rotnicke! Sooooo... Are we playing DND tonight? 😅
[07.07.22, 10:53:42] Kochanie Kas: Morning!! Unfortunately, we’ve got a small date planned for tonight 🌙
[07.07.22, 11:38:35] Maschi Hofbauer: that sounds lovely. are you generally interested in playing? I have holidays so I'm sure we could find a time to play if everyone is interested! what's the general mood?
[07.07.22, 12:45:22] David: The Berlin branch of the Rotniccy family would very much like to play some dnd. Would a day session work for you tomorrow? We have the release party of my moms book during the evening <3
[07.07.22, 14:41:47] Maschi Hofbauer: Yup sounds good to me! What time were you thinking?
[07.07.22, 14:50:55] Kochanie Kas: How about 2?
[07.07.22, 16:09:19] Kochanie Kas: He looks so friendly 😱😰 can’t wait??? 🫣
[07.07.22, 18:57:02] Maschi Hofbauer: Yup that works!! Exciting 😁

[07.07.22, 22:10:39] Kochanie Kas: Cool! I cooked lentil soup for lunch. Hope you like it!
[07.07.22, 23:28:23] Kochanie Kas: Could you grab on the way some bread that we could dip into the soup?
[08.07.22, 08:43:16] Maschi Hofbauer: Will do!!
[08.07.22, 12:14:04] David: Could you also grab a pack of longpapes?
[08.07.22, 13:54:50] Flora Cantagrel: I‘m running a bit late but I have long papes

[14.07.22, 17:54:27] Kochanie Kas: Maschi, such a joker recently 😅
[14.07.22, 23:35:20] Flora Cantagrel: Uh I‘m so happy it arrived and that it was understandable!! ❤️
[15.07.22, 07:44:16] Kochanie Kas: Grammar wise was 100% perfect! As well as content wise 🥹♥️
[15.07.22, 12:12:40] Flora Cantagrel: Wonderful ❤️‍🔥
[17.07.22, 10:43:42] Kochanie Kas: I don’t understand the crossed out and checked items, why are they crossed out and checked at the same time? Just to follow the same logic :)
[17.07.22, 10:53:07] Maschi Hofbauer: That's what docs does. For me checked just meant, someone's taking care of it😅
[17.07.22, 11:07:30] Kochanie Kas: Ok, then I’ll ignore the crossed out as for me it just means “not needed anymore/deleted”
[17.07.22, 11:43:20] Kochanie Kas: One more qq, sorry more might be coming, it’s my organization day today :)
[17.07.22, 11:43:46] Kochanie Kas: The tent, each couple should organize one or you might have a bigger one?
[17.07.22, 11:43:59] Kochanie Kas: Sorry also if some of the questions are just obvious
[17.07.22, 12:04:08] Flora Cantagrel: All good!
[17.07.22, 12:06:08] Flora Cantagrel: My mum has a big tent but that’s a Beast to put up so I’m not sure if it’s smart to take it. If we can get the car we might also sleep in the car!
[17.07.22, 12:24:00] Kochanie Kas: Ok 👌
[17.07.22, 13:56:59] Kochanie Kas: The dnd equipment is for our campaign sesh?
[18.07.22, 11:28:25] Kochanie Kas: Just asking as I might be ready with my part of the test one shot 👩🏽‍🎓🦅
[18.07.22, 11:29:15] David: I am also ready with mine :) next session is already mine, right?
[18.07.22, 15:26:18] Maschi Hofbauer: Yes! July 28th you will kick us off, right?
[18.07.22, 16:53:57] David: Yes will be so much fun
[23.07.22, 15:33:54] Maschi Hofbauer: Are you going to Karim today?
[23.07.22, 15:34:23] David: Yes you guys too? I was sure you are still out of town :D
[23.07.22, 15:34:41] David: 17:20 we take the s1 at Friedrichstraße
[23.07.22, 15:35:02] David: Herz and Leo will take the same train at gesundbrunnen and wollankstr respectively
[23.07.22, 15:35:26] Flora Cantagrel: Unfortunately not 😭
[23.07.22, 15:35:51] David: Awesome 😎 I mean for us, will you join the party train?
[23.07.22, 15:38:00] Flora Cantagrel: Yes I‘m in a deep post göhlen depression so it will be nice to see you guys!
‎[23.07.22, 15:38:12] Flora Cantagrel: ‎image omitted
[23.07.22, 15:38:19] David: Uh wow
[23.07.22, 15:38:32] Flora Cantagrel: How long do you want to stay?
[23.07.22, 15:41:27] Flora Cantagrel: Approximately
[23.07.22, 15:42:19] David: Hard to say but not crazy short neither crazy long. - so helpful, right?
[23.07.22, 15:42:51] Flora Cantagrel: Haha yes
[23.07.22, 15:43:03] David: Sort of depends on the kind of event it will turn out to be I guess
[23.07.22, 15:43:30] Flora Cantagrel: Ok 😅
[23.07.22, 15:48:11] David: Let me know if you make it to the party train 17:20 Friedrichstraße 17:33 wollankstr ;)
[23.07.22, 17:30:57] Flora Cantagrel: Heyy sorry obviously we didn’t manage to catch the party train 😅
[23.07.22, 17:31:16] Flora Cantagrel: We’ll be coming by car
[23.07.22, 17:31:30] David: Alright see you there!
[24.07.22, 12:33:55] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys when could you leave for the festival on Friday?
[24.07.22, 12:36:11] Flora Cantagrel: Luckily Maschi was able to organize us a car 🤗
[24.07.22, 12:45:05] Maschi Hofbauer: apparently there is a tent in the car as well... but I will find out for sure on tuesday!
[24.07.22, 15:53:28] Kochanie Kas: Sweet! Thanks!
[24.07.22, 15:53:48] Kochanie Kas: David needs to confirm his day off on Friday
[24.07.22, 15:53:48] Maschi Hofbauer: you guys would still need sleeping bags though!
[24.07.22, 15:54:41] Kochanie Kas: If he does, we are flexible
[25.07.22, 09:57:01] Maschi Hofbauer: Very excited for the first sorcerer's Challenge on Thursday!! Also.. I'll do some light prep for a potential Northern Lights game at the festival. If you guys wanna bring your cessi, Lio, naadur sheets and dice we can see whether we wanna play a round 😊
[25.07.22, 11:25:07] Flora Cantagrel: Uhhhhh
[26.07.22, 11:33:41] Maschi Hofbauer: Ok. So turns out there's no tent in the car.. the guy who had the car before took it with him 🙈 do you guys have a tent?
[26.07.22, 12:19:06] Flora Cantagrel: Got a tent!
[26.07.22, 12:20:49] Maschi Hofbauer: Also, can you guys organize botanical supplies? 🥳😁 Maybe the cost for that is similar to the prize of gas, which would make cost calculations in the end easier...
[26.07.22, 12:44:31] Kochanie Kas: Amazing! Anything else from camp equipment we need? Like sleeping mats, I’m not sure what the car also has
[26.07.22, 12:46:12] Maschi Hofbauer: We have two sleeping bags, and two inflatable mattresses but they are a bitch to blow up... so if you have mats for the tent that might be easier...
[26.07.22, 12:46:51] Flora Cantagrel: I have no ne mat and I’ve already reached out to some people for a second one
[26.07.22, 12:47:27] Flora Cantagrel: One!
[26.07.22, 12:47:33] Flora Cantagrel: I have one mat
[26.07.22, 12:51:26] Kochanie Kas: I have one mat too
[26.07.22, 12:51:59] Flora Cantagrel: Ok Great
[26.07.22, 12:53:21] Kochanie Kas: One person mat, just saying, tho I think it was inclined
[26.07.22, 12:53:40] Flora Cantagrel: Yes! But that’s all we needed
[26.07.22, 12:58:08] Flora Cantagrel: I think then there is only the cooker left but we’ll find that somewhere!
[26.07.22, 13:01:19] Kochanie Kas: Like the optimism!
[26.07.22, 16:15:09] Flora Cantagrel: Have a cooker 👍
[27.07.22, 11:53:15] David: Hey peops,
If possible could you come at 17 tomorrow? I’m a bit worried about the timing ⏱
[27.07.22, 12:09:54] Maschi Hofbauer: Even earlier if you want! And we don't have to get up early so we can go late if needed..
[27.07.22, 12:35:00] David: Perfect 👍 I’m not sure that I’ll be able to finish work earlier though so let’s go with 17. I’m so excited + nervous + eager to make it happen soon! Truly nervous though, don’t expect a lot!
[28.07.22, 09:12:00] Maschi Hofbauer: Do you guys still have sparkling wine and/or wine left over?
[28.07.22, 09:12:21] Maschi Hofbauer: I'm going grocery shopping.. any wishes for the festival/tonight?
[28.07.22, 09:37:15] Kochanie Kas: Only in Poland, sorry
[28.07.22, 09:39:23] Kochanie Kas: If you don’t mind and have a car for carrying a couple of nonalcoholic drinks like mate, Spezi, fritzs would be great for me as it’s a bit heavy but only if it’s not a trouble!
[28.07.22, 09:39:46] Kochanie Kas: Always snacks are welcomed for tonight. I am chasing time this week unfortunately
[28.07.22, 14:12:50] Flora Cantagrel: Don’t stress too much about it we will have a blast whatever happens!! (Knowing whole heartedly that I will stress a lot when it’s my turn 😅 But I also know that you will then tell me to not stress about it too much 😉)
[29.07.22, 11:10:55] Kochanie Kas: Morning! Prejoying quite much today 🧚🏼‍♀️ but unfortunately only 3 looks feasible
[29.07.22, 14:01:24] Kochanie Kas: Let us know when you are about to be at our place so we’ll bring all down :)
[29.07.22, 14:39:13] Flora Cantagrel: We’ll be there in 15!! 🤗🤩🥳
[29.07.22, 14:48:44] Flora Cantagrel: We’ll be there in 2! 😅

[02.08.22, 08:33:13] David: Hey peops,
So I wanted to ask to cancel book club this week. I am not at all far enough, neither is Flora if I remember correctly and so maybe we can just move it to Thursday in two weeks? 
Hope you have a great morning!
[02.08.22, 09:22:34] Maschi Hofbauer: Morning! And who runs what on Thursday then? Flora, Kas, or me? 😁
[02.08.22, 09:26:59] David: I thought we skip this Thursday tbh 😅
[02.08.22, 09:28:50] Maschi Hofbauer: Ohhhh really? 😕
[02.08.22, 09:30:47] Flora Cantagrel: Gooooood Morning! 🌸 Thursday in two weeks would be the 18th?
[02.08.22, 10:15:30] David: Yeah but that’s kas one shot isn’t it? Perhaps we could do the one shots and find an extra appointment for book club? I kinda don’t want to disturb the one shot flow
[02.08.22, 10:29:25] Flora Cantagrel: Yess that’s why I was asking I was thinking the same :)
[02.08.22, 11:20:23] Maschi Hofbauer: OK, and this week you don't want to play at all? Or just not book club?
[02.08.22, 11:59:20] David: I kinda need the time I think! So maybe just this week we skip it?
[03.08.22, 14:06:15] Maschi Hofbauer: Aaaaalright... If we have too 😅
[06.08.22, 09:00:36] Kochanie Kas: Morning! Excited to see you at 4 ✨🕺🏻🥂
[06.08.22, 15:24:11] Flora Cantagrel: Yaaaay!! 😍

[06.08.22, 15:41:25] Maschi Hofbauer: ‎Location: https://maps.google.com/?q=52.546474,13.359142
[06.08.22, 16:46:44] David: Want to come in and sit down?
[06.08.22, 16:47:57] David: Let’s go :)
[06.08.22, 16:49:01] Kochanie Kas: Ok
[11.08.22, 11:13:16] Flora Cantagrel: Helloooo guys, just to confirm 6pm tonight?
[11.08.22, 11:13:31] Maschi Hofbauer: HYPE 🥳😎
[11.08.22, 11:44:23] David: Works ;)
[11.08.22, 11:44:57] Flora Cantagrel: Please expect nothing more then a chaotic mess 😅
[11.08.22, 11:45:08] Flora Cantagrel: And me stumbling through it 🙈
[11.08.22, 11:45:19] David: It shall be awesome 🤩
[14.08.22, 18:28:38] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey guys. I've got the China virus. I'm ok with some symptoms. But since we saw each other on Thursday, you should probably test yourselves.. 🙄
[14.08.22, 18:53:30] Kochanie Kas: Oh gosh! Sorry to hear Maschi! Hope it’s not very invasive and thanks for letting us know. Take care!!!!! 🫖🛏
[15.08.22, 10:17:00] Kochanie Kas: Hi Maschi! How are you doing fighting the beast!? Do you need anything?
[15.08.22, 18:15:17] Kochanie Kas: Hey friends! I wanted to say last time that I’m shifting towards university patron, giving it some thought I feel it’s less directive, a bit less publicity out there. What do you think about it?
[17.08.22, 07:37:40] Flora Cantagrel: Hi! I like the university patron as well! I also like the idea of us finding out shady shit about the university and then kind of having a conflict there 🧐 At least to me the university sounded quite shady 😅 But I also have to say that I‘m not really thinking about dnd at the moment. Have a lovely day guys, hope you are well 💗
[18.08.22, 09:47:08] Kochanie Kas: Good morning! Unfortunately, I believe we shall move the book club once again?
[18.08.22, 10:19:18] David: I assumed as much as well
[18.08.22, 10:20:21] Maschi Hofbauer: Well, as we had it scheduled yesterday, I think it's safe to assume so 😅
[18.08.22, 10:20:42] David: Ah alright :D
[18.08.22, 10:20:55] David: Do you think you will be up and running next week?
[18.08.22, 10:27:38] Kochanie Kas: I have it in my calendar for today 🤨 anyways same outcome
[18.08.22, 10:29:42] Maschi Hofbauer: From my side for sure! We're playing Kas's one-shot right? 🤩
[18.08.22, 10:34:55] David: I hope so :)
[18.08.22, 10:36:05] Kochanie Kas: Yes! ✨🏔✨
‎[19.08.22, 11:15:18] Maschi Hofbauer: 2022_RPG_Pitch.pdf • ‎1 page ‎document omitted
[19.08.22, 11:16:17] Maschi Hofbauer: Good morning friends, I know you like some time for RPG decisions, so today I am sending you the pitch for different RPGs we might play in between D&D campaigns. Have a look, ask questions, and discuss! 😊
[19.08.22, 19:14:46] David: Hmm interesting stuff. 
I immediately notice that I have a preference for some of the systems. 
But before I get into it I already have a question:
Maschi, since you are the driving force behind the systems change, what do you hope to get out of it? 
What I mean to get at is, did you feel like you want to achieve a gaming experience that is particularly far away from the experience dnd delivered, or is it more just a general sense of curiosity about what is out there, or yet something entirely different?
[20.08.22, 09:37:07] Maschi Hofbauer: My main motivation is to widen all of our RPG-horizons, ultimately to give us a fresh perspective on this hobby of ours, and come away with some ideas for our D&D game.. But all of these systems are chosen because I think they have the potential to do just that. Which ones do you gravitate towards?
[20.08.22, 09:52:58] David: 13th age and blades in the dark. 
13th age seems very intriguing although somewhat vaguely similar to what I presume eberron will be like. This might be good though since as you put it, we might be able to come up with some ideas for our main game. 
Blades in the dark sounds good to me because the rule set promises to be interesting: many rules, but all d6 based. That’s kinda fly. 
The alien rpg I’m not so interested in. This whole bodily horror genre isn’t really that intriguing to me.
[21.08.22, 11:09:22] Kochanie Kas: Numenera (first choice) and 13th Age sound interesting to me. I’m not so keen to play very loosy on rules game but of course it’s just my opinion/preference. 
Alien RPG I could play always but I believe that’s not so popular in our little circle…
[21.08.22, 16:15:31] Kochanie Kas: Would it be ok to start at 5 on Thursday?
[21.08.22, 22:15:38] Flora Cantagrel: Of course! 🤎
[22.08.22, 06:26:04] Maschi Hofbauer: Yess. How exciting! 🤩
‎[23.08.22, 07:36:22] David: ‎video omitted
[23.08.22, 10:22:44] Maschi Hofbauer: Awwww so cool!! 😍
[23.08.22, 10:22:58] Maschi Hofbauer: Yes test is negative. I'm back in school 😎
[25.08.22, 14:28:40] Flora Cantagrel: Veeerry cute 😍🥰
[02.09.22, 10:53:52] Maschi Hofbauer: I never gave you XP for the festival sessions! 😱

[02.09.22, 11:22:59] Maschi Hofbauer: Guys... What a beautiful quote from this book I'm reading:
"I had no right to claim him, I knew it. But in a solitary life, there are rare moments when another soul dips near yours, as stars once a year brush the earth. Such a constellation was he to me."
😭
[02.09.22, 20:17:09] Kochanie Kas: *327,835*

[03.09.22, 12:36:02] Flora Cantagrel: Oh gosh 😱
[03.09.22, 12:37:29] Flora Cantagrel: In my calendar I already marked us down for playing on October the first, is that correct?
[03.09.22, 12:38:40] Maschi Hofbauer: Yes, I have that too! Is that one already online, @4915229405643 ?
[03.09.22, 12:40:29] Flora Cantagrel: Nope I think the course start on the 3rd thats why we talked about playing once more in person.
[03.09.22, 12:41:01] Flora Cantagrel: I was asking because both you an Kas put the first in for potentially playing the other campaign
[03.09.22, 12:41:23] Maschi Hofbauer: ... changing that now... 😅
[03.09.22, 12:42:33] Flora Cantagrel: ok 😅
[04.09.22, 11:39:40] Kochanie Kas: Of course forgot, sorry!

[06.09.22, 11:09:37] Flora Cantagrel: No, as far as I know that’s correct :)
[06.09.22, 11:10:01] Kochanie Kas: Uhhhh amazing!🪩
[06.09.22, 11:46:09] Maschi Hofbauer: Yup! Awesome that we manage to play a couple of sessions even in these busy weeks!
[06.09.22, 16:05:53] Flora Cantagrel: Indeed! 😍
[06.09.22, 16:08:50] Flora Cantagrel: But unfortunately I won’t make it to the bookclub this week. There is just too much to do for the patient exam and sadly I won’t be able to take tmr evening of :( I feel really bad about it because it’s been so long since we had a bookclub! So please go ahead and have it without me!! Hope all is well on your end! Love 🤎
[06.09.22, 18:39:06] David: Hey peops,
So let’s play tennis this week. We could check out sport park triftal. I feel so good after playing and think it would be really fun 🤩
[06.09.22, 18:42:08] Maschi Hofbauer: I'm down
[06.09.22, 18:45:48] David: 19-21?
[06.09.22, 18:48:10] David: Reserved a court at triftal for now
[06.09.22, 18:49:08] David: It would be 17 per person if we go as 3 for two hours
[06.09.22, 18:50:06] Maschi Hofbauer: I don't have a racket though
[06.09.22, 18:50:24] David: Well hopefully you can rent there
[06.09.22, 18:50:38] David: Your parents don’t have one either?
[06.09.22, 19:10:39] Maschi Hofbauer: I will just rent one 😊
[07.09.22, 09:15:02] Kochanie Kas: 🎾K!
[07.09.22, 09:15:43] Kochanie Kas: We can find a new date or just go with 1st Thursday in October and do it online?
[08.09.22, 08:55:00] Flora Cantagrel: Sure!
[08.09.22, 12:02:29] Kochanie Kas: Depends on David if he has time and space for it in Kraków. But hopefully!
[11.09.22, 19:15:55] David: Hey guys,
Bennet needs help on the 15th so I would love to move dnd to the 16th if possible?
[11.09.22, 19:17:25] Maschi Hofbauer: We're going to a birthday party on the 16th 🙄
What about 14th?
[11.09.22, 19:18:45] David: Would work for me I think 💭
[12.09.22, 08:51:17] Maschi Hofbauer: For Flora as well :)
[12.09.22, 08:56:42] Flora Cantagrel: Ah yes Sorry!
[12.09.22, 14:50:52] Kochanie Kas: Sounds good!
[14.09.22, 11:52:14] Flora Cantagrel: Hey guys, when do we start today? ✨
[14.09.22, 11:58:25] David: I was hoping 6? That was kinda the default time I had hoped would be agreeable to everyone?
[14.09.22, 12:43:33] Flora Cantagrel: Sure!
[14.09.22, 15:18:25] Maschi Hofbauer: I can bring tandooris (Pakistani bread with stuff on it) are you guys interested?

[24.09.22, 12:04:35] Flora Cantagrel: Works for me!
[24.09.22, 13:12:58] Kochanie Kas: Nice, it would be amazing to keep this timeframe:)
[26.09.22, 08:03:08] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey friends, also, can you think again about the game we wanna play next until Saturday? Then we can pick one then and I can get to reading it etc. 😊
[28.09.22, 11:46:31] Kochanie Kas: Hey! I think David and I already shared our picks and as far as I remember we were the most aligned on Numenera as the trio but as said I’m happy with anything that is not too loose in rules:)
[28.09.22, 12:53:28] Flora Cantagrel: Yess! I only shared my picks in that conversation do you want me to write them down as well?
[28.09.22, 14:03:49] Kochanie Kas: Is this question to me? Not so sure 😅
[28.09.22, 14:04:09] Flora Cantagrel: Sorry no 😂
[28.09.22, 14:09:53] Flora Cantagrel: But it was unclear, I agree 😂

[06.10.22, 11:28:28] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey friends, what's our plan now? Do we do book club online? Do we play a D&D game online? 😊 How is everyone feeling?
[06.10.22, 11:39:34] Kochanie Kas: Hey hey hey! I can do BC online but tbh I would rather play in person taking into account the stage of our game :)
‎[07.10.22, 00:32:15] David: ‎image omitted
[07.10.22, 07:17:40] Maschi Hofbauer: Ok cool, how about Thursday the 13th?
[07.10.22, 07:19:41] Maschi Hofbauer: I thought we could do a "planning" D&D session which might work well online. Just sort of talk through next steps, some roleplay etc. ... What do you think about that?
[07.10.22, 08:28:58] Kochanie Kas: Yey! Amazing to hear!
[07.10.22, 08:30:11] Kochanie Kas: I don’t be available between 13th till 16th, sorry! But from 17th on in in! Also till 12th I’m available

[07.10.22, 10:28:27] Flora Cantagrel: Sure! Just planning is fine with me as I already said, I‘m with kas on this one and don’t want to play online since we have so precious few sessions left in this campaign!
[07.10.22, 13:14:35] Maschi Hofbauer: How about Wednesday evening book club then? The 12th?
[07.10.22, 13:59:30] David: Not that my plans are very extensive in the evenings - but yeah works :D
[09.10.22, 12:40:05] Kochanie Kas: At what time do you wanna dial in fir the book club?

[10.10.22, 18:48:41] Maschi Hofbauer: I'm just gonna have to get home by 10 because I have another Unterrichtsbesuch the next morning... But should be enough time.
[10.10.22, 19:21:00] Kochanie Kas: So coool!!!!! Where is it?
[10.10.22, 19:22:05] Kochanie Kas: Also the video is a great practice tool! Never thought of it but this way you can actually see yourself playing, I know it’s not a revelation but somehow never occurred to me 😅
[10.10.22, 19:23:14] Maschi Hofbauer: Next to Schiller Bibliothek.
[10.10.22, 19:24:12] Kochanie Kas: Uh! I would have to pack heavy for Leopoldplatz visits
[10.10.22, 19:48:21] Kochanie Kas: It’s the Glühwein walk with Maschi discussion 🤣

[21.10.22, 17:11:58] David: Wtf 😳
[21.10.22, 22:06:28] Kochanie Kas: Oh holy moly! Some insane stuff! I’m happy that there is kindness in her eyes even in AI creation 😊 
Tho the hand is a bit off..

[23.10.22, 17:35:23] David: It’s such a cool game. Have we ever tried all the new characters that came with the English version? 
We played the classic today and I didn’t recognize a lot of the newer ones.
[23.10.22, 17:38:55] Maschi Hofbauer: Like the queen and the artist, and the librarian and stuff like that?
[23.10.22, 17:40:28] David: Yeah I recognized some but there are plenty new ones in there
[23.10.22, 17:41:41] Maschi Hofbauer: Oh ok! Well Flora and I played that game to death in göhlen and didn't really enjoy it that much anymore after round 100... 😅
[23.10.22, 17:44:27] David: Ah no worries. We could try out some new classic board games some time though. I forget sometimes how much I like them.

[24.10.22, 07:21:34] Flora Cantagrel: Yess the newer version of the game has three collection of characters you can switch up super awesome!
[28.10.22, 07:17:19] Maschi Hofbauer: That was *Session 107 - The Call of the Raven* ... no XP necessary, but if you manage to defend the Fortress of Memories, you can all choose an epic boon for your characters in case we ever play them again 😉 good luck!

[16.11.22, 12:19:56] Maschi Hofbauer: I can do 18:30 this week (given the momentous task ahead 😬) ! Plus, I don't have to get up early on Saturday so we have wiggle room into the night.
[16.11.22, 18:12:36] Kochanie Kas: Oki! @4917676887044 @4915229405643 wanna strategize at 6:00?

[24.11.22, 14:39:15] David: 18:30 would be the earliest I can do
[24.11.22, 14:40:02] Maschi Hofbauer: Good! 😊
[25.11.22, 07:14:40] Maschi Hofbauer: Hey guys, so I complete my state exam on Thursday, Dec 8th. I would love to have you guys over that evening, have a (hopefully) celebratory drink, and do a relaxed Numenera session zero! Totally cool if you're too busy, just let me know! 🤗
[25.11.22, 09:12:33] David: That sounds awesome and totally like we should celebrate you that day!
[28.11.22, 15:35:10] Kochanie Kas: Hey you lovely ppl! Hope you are having a wonderful start to the week! 
I wanted to ask you if you could be so kind and maybe borrow us a sleeping bag or two for the weekend? My brother is coming with his full family and honestly we do not have 7 blankets at home 😅 it would be just for one night✨🌙
[28.11.22, 15:46:45] Flora Cantagrel: Of course I think we just have one here right now but I can also ask Lukas und Lena if you need more?
[28.11.22, 19:06:15] Kochanie Kas: Ty!!! I will properly count as I get home and will let you know if we need more than one :)
[29.11.22, 09:11:17] Kochanie Kas: One shall be enough:)

[30.11.22, 19:16:01] David: We are currently walking from Warschauer are you Glühweining? :D
[02.12.22, 08:12:26] Kochanie Kas: Hey hey! I’m feeling slightly better but I’m still coughing a lot… letting you know so you can decide if you wanna take the chance tonight and see if you catch it from me or not (if you haven’t gotten some already after Wednesday)🙈

[08.06.23, 10:47:12] Maschi Hofbauer: Hello friends, I hope you and Franio are well!

Morrie is home again after her surgery yesterday in which almost 30 teeth were removed to deal with her chronic inflammation in the mouth. She had a fantastic team headed by Dr. Rux, a specialist for veterinarian dental work. 

The whole procedure took multiple hours, and the total cost is now 2,066€ 

I set up a GoFundMe campaign for Morrie. I know money is tight for all of us, still, Morrie, Flora and I appreciate every single euro anyone can contribute.

If you can, share the link with any other friends of animals who might want to contribute 🙂

Take care, and lots of love to you guys and Franio!

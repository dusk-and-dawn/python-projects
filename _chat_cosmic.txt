[06.07.22, 11:21:10] Kathrin Koeller: Hat sich erledigt, aber ihr fliegt auch glaub ich, sowieso grade 😘
[06.07.22, 12:26:50] David: Just landed
[06.07.22, 12:27:00] David: Still need help?
[06.07.22, 12:27:33] Kathrin Koeller: Nope. Thanks. Welcome to Berlin 😘
[06.07.22, 21:29:03] Kochanie Kas: Hi! I checked with the olandia hotel/spa and we would like to be gone to use the voucher Sunday 10th till Thursday 14th. 
As we spoke today if this is not suitable to keep Franio company at this time I’ll contact Flora ☺️
[07.07.22, 12:52:58] Kochanie Kas: Good morning! ☀️ at what time and where should we show up with many cheers tomorrow?  🌈🥂💜
[07.07.22, 13:17:51] Kathrin Koeller: Hello my dears, I hope you’ve enjoyed some relaxing and nice evening after your journeys.

[08.07.22, 22:52:04] Kochanie Kas: We just also wanted to let you know that Flora can take care of Franio Monday till Friday, I think it will be the most convenient so we don’t shift your plans.

[10.07.22, 10:11:45] Kochanie Kas: Kathrin, we also forgot, with the new holiday planning we’ll be out of Berlin 29-31.07 and wanted to ask if you would have lust, time and capacity to keep our Franio company? 
We keep on looking if this is not the case ☺️
[10.07.22, 10:12:04] Kochanie Kas: Have a sunny sunny Sunday! ☀️
[10.07.22, 13:47:12] Kathrin Koeller: Yes, I love the grace and their humour while skipping through the rain in sandals ❤️
[10.07.22, 13:50:49] Kathrin Koeller: I need one more day to see whether that‘s possible. We are cat sitting in Kreuzberg until the day before. But will be in touch about it tomorrow 😘
[10.07.22, 14:02:51] Kathrin Koeller: Also, I think I left my electrical toothbrush charger and my shampoo and conditioner at your place. That’s not urgent. I wonder, did I also leave two tiny rings with simple flowers in thomasiusstr.? Probably not but just wanted to ask. Also I still have David‘s summer jacket which I‘ve just picked up from Sonnenburger and put onto the balcony. I‘m sorry I didn’t think about that before but have done so much apartment hopping recently that I was losing track a bit 🤦‍♀️
[10.07.22, 14:33:37] Kochanie Kas: Yes, we have the shampoo, conditioner and charger here ☺️ unfortunately, no rings. 
 The jacket is not a problem, don’t worry!
[10.07.22, 14:36:20] Kochanie Kas: If you would like to pick it up, we are home tonight and from tomorrow on Flora will be here.
Otherwise we can make an exchange the next time we see each other.
[10.07.22, 14:40:44] Kathrin Koeller: Exchange next Sunday would be perfect. I wish you a great time in the spa ❤️
[10.07.22, 14:58:39] Kochanie Kas: Thank you!!!
[16.07.22, 20:23:40] Kathrin Koeller: My dears, I hope this time you had a truly relaxing trip. 
What do you think about tomorrow at 6pm for the exchange of goodies and a little „Schnack“?
I won‘t be able to stay too long as I still have to speed translate afterwards again. Lots of love 💕

Are you both doing well?
[30.07.22, 10:56:07] Kathrin Koeller: That sounds interesting. Looking forward to hearing from you. Sorry, I hope I didn‘t have you worried. Your last question didn’t show up on the preview.
[30.07.22, 10:58:44] Kathrin Koeller: Puppy had breakfast, I had coffee and once again I‘ve been pulled into your Time magazine, Kasia, reading it from front to back and only finally getting to the article I wanted to read in the first place 🤣
[30.07.22, 11:02:42] Kathrin Koeller: Yup, we‘re being a bit lazy but as we were working on my taxes last night consider it okay to be chilling a bit 😊
[30.07.22, 11:04:35] Kathrin Koeller: Hope you are okay, too. I can imagine you have a lot of different feelings being at the festival. But cool you’re doing this 😘

It was very ensuing knowing you two are together 🥰

[31.07.22, 21:15:08] Kathrin Koeller: Whenever I looked into the fridge, he looked too, then turned his head back to me as if to say what do you think, what are we having?
[31.07.22, 21:49:16] Kochanie Kas: Yes! Always assuming he is invited to join, always hopeful!
[31.07.22, 21:53:19] Kathrin Koeller: Welcome back, my dears, by the way. I hope you had a great time at the festival. 
I was once again very enlightened by reading your time magazine, Kasia. And it was once again a random article I stumbled upon that impressed me the most. This time on the difference between empowerment and power.

But but but: I‘ve spoken to Sebastian and JH obviously and October 24 it is for our post birthday celebration including some bowling and stuff. So keep the early evening free my dears and l‘ll be getting to you about the whereabouts and so on. 
All krakow travelers I wish a good non disruptive journey tomorrow and I wish us all a good time 😘
Lots of love, Kat xxx

We are on our way in a very busy train but it’s just sitting now 😅

[14.10.22, 18:46:27] Kathrin Koeller: Please say hi to them from me 😘
[14.10.22, 19:30:41] David: Jan karski, he told the allied forces about the concentration camps in Poland.

[17.10.22, 11:06:05] Kathrin Koeller: What an incredibly beautiful explorer. Looks like he is having a good time 😊
[18.10.22, 15:54:52] Kathrin Koeller: A question for my current translation: blades in the dark characters: do you know them, are they well known in the gamer world here?
Answer can be yes or no but would be much appropriated by tonight 🙏🙏🙏
[18.10.22, 19:11:01] Kathrin Koeller: I would like to book the bowling as I‘ll be away over the next couple of days. 
A lot of places are closed on Mondays but the bowl House which is on storkower str. 105-107 is open, probably an hour from thomasiusstr. 
Would 6.30 pm good for you, Kasia and David? Lots of love ❤️
[18.10.22, 20:34:35] David: I know blades of the dark but I couldn’t name the characters
[18.10.22, 20:35:30] David: No it’s too early I will need at least until 18 if not 18:30 before I can leave on Monday.
[18.10.22, 20:35:48] David: We need to arrange work walk and feed the puppy and get all other things in order
[18.10.22, 21:09:49] Kathrin Koeller: Ah, okay, I thought we said early evening and Monday would be a good day to get you away from work. I‘ll check the places again whether there’s maybe sth a bit closer for you. Will be in touch 😘
[18.10.22, 21:10:30] David: Leaving the house at 18 is kinda the early version after returning
[18.10.22, 21:12:47] Kathrin Koeller: Okay that’s good to know.
[19.10.22, 15:14:27] David: hey mom, so I forgot to wish for this for my birthday but would absolutely love to get it for Christmas. You can also ask Kas to join the present or something like that! I really want the original that also supports a Ukrainian developer studio and will use the mask regularly (once a week, as soon as our new dnd campaign starts - where I play a droid!): https://qudi.space/
[19.10.22, 15:16:30] David: the black version ... of course

[21.10.22, 09:57:02] Kathrin Koeller: Fingers crossed that it will all work well. Hope you had a good time. I‘m looking forward to hearing your stories on Monday evening. By the way, I am still waiting to hear back from another bowling place. But Monday night is on. Lots of love 😘❤️
‎[21.10.22, 10:03:27] David: ‎image omitted
[21.10.22, 10:07:14] Kathrin Koeller: 🤣🤣🤣 I loooove it. You go folks. ❤️❤️❤️
[21.10.22, 11:54:52] Kochanie Kas: It’s so sad! All our little cuddlings are well protected! 

Good luck at the fair!!! 
✨💚🍀✨
[21.10.22, 22:35:24] Kochanie Kas: Thank you for the curtains Kathrin 💚 it looks like David is very happy with the revived room🙌
[21.10.22, 22:37:08] David: Super happy 😊 what a surprise to come home to
[22.10.22, 11:25:27] Kathrin Koeller: Thank you. It was super intense but good 😊 
Was rushing from one adrenaline booster to the next. Now super knocked out on train 🚂
[22.10.22, 11:30:21] Kathrin Koeller: So happy David likes it. And what a great surprise to come too, right! Happy the curtains fit 😘
[22.10.22, 11:30:47] Kathrin Koeller: Come home to
[22.10.22, 11:55:30] David: I’m super proud! It sounds like a very intense but rewarding period. Those are often the best of times when we reflect back! Very glad you pushed through, make sure to get ample rest now though. 
Maybe vabali when you get the chance, or some other active restoration activity…
[22.10.22, 13:11:20] Kathrin Koeller: Thanks so much for these encouraging words!  
Some active restoration activity will definitely take place on Monday evening. 19.00 in Schöneberg, I‘ll text you the exact address later when the connection is better. So much looking forward to to this post birthday bowling party 🎳
[23.10.22, 15:36:23] Kathrin Koeller: So, my dears, here comes the address for the bowling event tomorrow evening: 
Berolina Bowling Lounge
Kleiststr. 3-6
The closest underground station is Nollendorfplatz. However I don‘t know whether the U2 is running. 
Let‘s meet there at 18.50 as our slot starts at 19.00. I‘m so looking forward to seeing you. Lots of love, Kathrin

[24.10.22, 18:56:05] David: We are on the way, but due to a bus not coming we might be a few minutes behind. Not much though
[24.10.22, 18:58:06] Kathrin Koeller: No worries. Public transport is ready a drag at the moment. Fastest for me was actually the bike. I‘ll wait on the pavement
[24.10.22, 18:59:12] Kathrin Koeller: Really not ready

[25.10.22, 18:27:34] Kochanie Kas: It’s a darker colored Roc✨
[25.10.22, 21:13:21] Kathrin Koeller: Impressive!

What is a golden Yoshi?
[03.02.23, 12:10:32] Jh: Flugente got that swag
[03.02.23, 12:13:04] Kathrin Koeller: Definitely

[03.02.23, 13:06:42] David: Oh yeah
[03.02.23, 13:07:25] David: Sweetheart but flugente rains supreme over the cuddly toy sky
[03.02.23, 13:12:29] Kathrin Koeller: For sure. He would only shoot her down accidentally while targeting something else
[03.02.23, 13:30:48] Kochanie Kas: It’s a bit of Koeller’s corner with the small pottery from grandpa and the pretty box from you 🧡
[03.02.23, 13:31:35] Kochanie Kas: Oh wow! So dreamy! And so close by!!! ⛵️
[05.02.23, 18:20:08] Kathrin Koeller: a koeller‘s corner 🤣 I love it!
[21.02.23, 16:25:25] Kathrin Koeller: Hey my dears, it’s been sooooo long. I hope you’re well and feeling the first glimpses of spring on your walks in lovely Tiergarten. 
I would love to invite you over for some dinner next week. Actually so far you can choose which evening but please let me know soon so I can plan around it. Sending lots of love and kisses 😘
[21.02.23, 16:43:51] Kochanie Kas: Hey hey! It’s been! Indeed! Unfortunately, for me next week is very tricky but from March 6th my schedule is wide open ☺️sorry!!
[21.02.23, 17:06:03] Kathrin Koeller: Wow! Hope it‘s good busyness 😊
Could you pencil in Monday 13/3? I‘ll be in touch. Sending lots of love your way 😘
[21.02.23, 17:28:58] Kochanie Kas: It’s a mix of all emotions 😵‍💫 and yes! 13.03 works :)
[21.02.23, 17:30:56] Kathrin Koeller: Lots of power and good energy. Thinking of you guys 😘❤️
[21.02.23, 17:32:02] David: Hey children of the sun 🌞,
That sounds lovely!
[06.03.23, 20:54:42] Kochanie Kas: Hello hello! Hope the whole crew is doing well!!!! 💙❄️
Kathrin I know we see each other next Monday but I just didn’t want to forget this one Franio plea 😊 we would like to use our tropical island wedding voucher between 28-31.03 and it’s an overnight stay. Would you be available for 2 days during this timeframe to stay with the sweetest dog? Feel free as always to say “no”! 
Btw JH and David, Jasiu is growing into a big Minecraft fan, only consuming videos and books now but the interest is there! 💥🧨
‎[06.03.23, 20:55:09] Kochanie Kas: ‎image omitted
[06.03.23, 21:41:02] Kathrin Koeller: How could I say no to this look? I think it should be fine. I‘ll be in touch shortly
[06.03.23, 21:43:07] Kochanie Kas: Thank you 💗 sending lots of hugs!!!
[06.03.23, 21:45:02] Kathrin Koeller: And back to you guys. Missing you and am very angry with myself for not having been in touch for so long 😔
[06.03.23, 22:02:27] Kochanie Kas: We are catching up very soon!!! 🥰
[06.03.23, 22:05:46] Kathrin Koeller: So looking forward to seeing you guys 😘
On my way to cologne tomorrow. On Wednesday we have a reading in front of 200 + students. Crazy. Trying not to panic 😱
[06.03.23, 22:09:09] Kochanie Kas: Lucky students!!!! It’s going to be amazing!!! You guys are gonna be amazing!!!! 🧑‍🎓☕️📚
[06.03.23, 22:10:33] Kathrin Koeller: You are so nice. Thank you 🙏
[13.03.23, 07:48:11] David: Hey lovely people,
I’m currently on the way to Brandenburg and was hoping that maybe you guys could visit us today so that I don’t have to go to brb, then go back to you, then go with pup. Would be much appreciated!! 
Looking forward to seeing you today. 

All the best <3
[13.03.23, 10:59:53] Kathrin Koeller: Yes, we can come. JH has a study group meeting in the afternoon and is giving their MSA presentation early tomorrow morning. So, they would come directly after their group meeting and be at your place at 6.30 pm. I would come directly from work too. We will have to leave at 9pm at the latest. 
Looking forward to seeing you later. Lots of love 😘❤️
[13.03.23, 16:01:22] Kathrin Koeller: I am also now shopping and making a vegan potato gratin. If you could maybe make some veggies, that would be great. I can’t transport that too. Lots of love and see you later. 😘❤️
[13.03.23, 22:31:13] Kathrin Koeller: Albeit shortly it was so good to see you today. Feasting together and starting conversations and hugging and fighting for teddy 🧸 
To be continued, okay?
And David, I was thinking talk to JH about the video game sometime and maybe you can even have a look at it together sometime. And fingers crossed tomorrow morning at 8 please 😘
[19.03.23, 12:22:24] Kathrin Koeller: This is number 3 checking in to confirm their attendance in the house of Franio & Family from March 28 to March 30. When exactly would you want number 3 to be there?
[19.03.23, 13:06:20] Kochanie Kas: Hello #3! #1 & 2 would be happy leave around 11:00am on the 28th and would be back in the house of F&F on 29th evening. Would coming before 11:00am be possible? Otherwise we will arrange for the key swap beforehand:)
‎[19.03.23, 13:06:41] Kochanie Kas: ‎image omitted
[19.03.23, 14:00:06] Kathrin Koeller: #3 will be there @ 10 am on 28 march. The confirmed day back is 29 March not 30?
[19.03.23, 14:01:56] Kathrin Koeller: This one is really getting better and better at the „Hundeblick“
[19.03.23, 14:22:53] Kochanie Kas: Yes, 29th evening, its one night ✨
[19.03.23, 14:23:47] Kochanie Kas: Trains every day 🏋🏼‍♀️👀
[20.03.23, 18:43:47] David: https://www.hostel-hamm.de/kontakt
[20.03.23, 19:04:07] Kathrin Koeller: So, I called but there was only an answering machine. I left my number and I‘ll send them an email. Also spoke to Birgit and if only the two of you and Franio came to stay with them it would work. You could stay in their upstairs area and they would be downstairs. Maybe that would be the easiest if the hotel doesn’t work out. Then I would just find a single room for myself. I‘ll be back about it with more info tomorrow 😘
[20.03.23, 19:15:32] Kochanie Kas: Thank you so much!!!! 🌈 let us know if you need anything from us!
[21.03.23, 14:19:36] Kathrin Koeller: Something completely different: do you want to come to my atelier Thursday shortly before 2pm? There will be a short congregation between 2 and 3 pm. Can’t say more but you would have to be on time. Gethsemanestr.4, close to U Schönhauser Allee, behind the church 🙋‍♀️
[21.03.23, 16:45:41] David: Unfortunately I work at that hour still and already have scheduled meetings :/
[21.03.23, 16:48:45] Kathrin Koeller: Davide, I thought that was very likely, as it’s in the middle of the day but wanted to invite you anyway.
[21.03.23, 17:21:29] Kochanie Kas: Same on my end, unfortunately middays are very tricky to arrange… 🙈
[21.03.23, 17:23:56] Kathrin Koeller: Yes, I know and I really understand. I just can‘t change the time but will be in touch.
[21.03.23, 17:27:19] David: And let us know what is happening there! Sounds intriguing
[21.03.23, 17:28:02] Kochanie Kas: YES!!!
[21.03.23, 17:28:15] Kathrin Koeller: In other news I got a message from the hotel this morning that unfortunately they aren’t taking in any dogs. So I would now say you take the upper floor in the „super old people’s house“, they take the lower floor and I‘ll get a single room close by.  And we can still hang in the evening. Would that be okay with you? 😘
[21.03.23, 17:29:11] Kathrin Koeller: Will do ❤️
[21.03.23, 17:29:28] David: Can I chat with kas when she is back? At the moment she is still in the office..
[21.03.23, 17:32:57] Kathrin Koeller: Sure. I spoke to Birgit again last night and she assured me that they can sleep together in the basement. And the top floor is separated from the rest of the apartment so you would have some space for yourselves. 
I’m really sorry for this.

[23.03.23, 08:31:57] Jh: Yes I'm in a hotel
[23.03.23, 08:32:14] Jh: I'm here on an exchange program
[23.03.23, 08:33:11] Kochanie Kas: Sweet! What’s the exchange activity? Besides exchange itself if you know what I mean ☺️
[23.03.23, 08:36:39] Kathrin Koeller: Wow, that was quick! Even for somebody who has lived there 😁
[23.03.23, 08:40:17] Kochanie Kas: There is only one so oddly shaped skyscraper in the whole world I guess 🙈
Plus its a city of great memories to me 💫
[23.03.23, 08:51:02] David: JH - very cool, Hope your visit is fun!
[23.03.23, 08:57:07] Jh: Yes it quite nice

[28.03.23, 09:18:07] Kochanie Kas: Hello Kathrin! ☀️ We are a bit delayed hence no rush needed. I do not think we will leave before 12:)
[28.03.23, 09:22:49] Kathrin Koeller: Okay, I’m kind of finishing packing here. Will take it slow but come and work quietly in a corner as I have to start working. 😘
[28.03.23, 09:25:58] Kathrin Koeller: By the way I got a message in the middle of the night addressed to „Hallo Mama“ that the sender has a new number and can be contacted on WhatsApp under this number. No name at the end. I think it’s Spam but just want to make sure it’s not from you.
[28.03.23, 09:26:44] Kochanie Kas: Hmmm 🤔 no new numbers on our end…

[28.03.23, 18:25:07] Kathrin Koeller: He‘s fine, only whinced a bit in the beginning so I took him on a walk and after that everything was fine. I’m off now to my friends but back at 10 pm

JH and I are spending the first week of the Easter holidays here, will both work but thought it would be so wonderful if we could also see you guys sometime this week. Could be an evening or even a lunch break. JH will also pick up the switch this evening, so there are options… 
What do you think? Lots of love ❤️

[22.05.23, 09:52:28] David: Love it reminds me of my dragon painting times - good vibes 😎
[22.05.23, 19:54:26] Jh: Thank you for all the love for the dragon they are very flattered. However they lack a name so does anyone have any cool dragon names?
[22.05.23, 20:42:16] Kathrin Koeller: As the least dragon experienced one I will make the first bid. Still quite conventional but what about Saphira?
[22.05.23, 21:09:30] Kochanie Kas: If we go with gems I would call the dragon Emeraldo but my heart loves cute names for dragon and this one looks like Spoti but with German-pronounces “S” 🥰
[22.05.23, 21:10:38] Kathrin Koeller: Awwh
[22.05.23, 21:11:44] David: Spoti, spoti 🐉
[22.05.23, 21:38:12] Jh: Agreed tho I love emeraldo aswell
[24.05.23, 14:35:55] Jh: Ok so it's final. The dragon is called Spotify or for short Spoti. He loves belly rubs and cauliflower
[24.05.23, 15:24:08] David: Adorable 🥰
[24.05.23, 15:44:01] Jh: Thank you
[24.05.23, 16:29:26] Kathrin Koeller: Belly rubs and cauliflower! The cutie 🥰 Love them already. Hope we catch another glimpse of them some time soon.

[18.06.23, 19:52:01] Kathrin Koeller: Hey Kasia & David, it’s been ages! Do you want to come to Winsstr. Friday evening? That would be so cool! 
Also my father was very flexible and suggested maybe meeting 15/16/29 or 30 July. Would any of these dates be possible for you? Going there in the morning and back at night.
[21.06.23, 22:14:17] Kathrin Koeller: So, what do you think about Friday or Saturday morning/midday would also be great. We would love to treat you 😘
[22.06.23, 19:41:30] Kochanie Kas: Hello hello! ☀️
Hope you all are doing well despite the heat and melting asphalt!🌇
I’m very sorry we are quite silent here, honestly I’m feeling bad it’s so hard to arrange for us to meet but it’s been hell of a ride last weeks and even more is coming up! I’ve been checking with David and I know he is in touch more so he did pass on that we are hosting my parents today and tomorrow and I’m also gone from tomorrow on till July 4th. 
Nevertheless, I really hope we can make an arrangement to visit grandpa, looking at the schedules we think 29th or 30th July would work the best for us. Please let us know if this can work out, would be lovely! ♥️
Thinking about lovely things, we are going for a wedding of my cousin 7-9.07 and unfortunately pups don’t tag along…. We’ll be leaving from haupi on 7th (17:52) and will be back on 9th (20:30 ZOB). I hate to write here after a long silence and immediately ask for a dog sitting favor but we always think of you first#️⃣3️⃣💙
Of course grabbing a coffee and a chat before and after dog sitting is always super cool, I enjoy it a lot ☺️
Anyways, let us know what you think and of course “no” is always an answer! 
Once again hope you are all well and I’m looking forward to all the catching up!!!!! 🐾😘
[22.06.23, 19:42:23] Jh: I would be up for seeing puppy idk about mom but sounds fun
[22.06.23, 19:42:37] Jh: Hope you two have been having a good time to
[22.06.23, 19:43:25] Jh: I need to ask mother and hopefully her and me can look after cutie

[22.06.23, 19:51:43] Jh: Nice
[22.06.23, 19:52:04] Jh: Enjoy it while you still have it 🤣
[22.06.23, 19:52:12] Jh: Which probably means a long time

[22.06.23, 20:18:59] Jh: Hahahahahahahahahahahahshagahaha
[22.06.23, 20:19:21] Jh: No I just know that I'm not great at dog care on my own so
[22.06.23, 20:20:25] Kochanie Kas: Matter of practice. We all started there 😅
[22.06.23, 20:21:29] Jh: True

[22.06.23, 20:22:51] Kochanie Kas: Winter Kas version 🐇
[22.06.23, 20:23:10] Jh: Hahaha nice
[22.06.23, 21:45:33] Kathrin Koeller: Hey you cosmic cons. Nice to hear from you. Sorry I was in a really long zoom while you guys were conversing.
[22.06.23, 22:10:34] Kathrin Koeller: I know it’s super busy times. But we need to see each other soon. There’s some serious missing going on. David and I spoke yesterday and we said we would meet the week after next when JH is at my place again. Looking into my calendar I realized that JH is on a class trip that week. Ahhh. And guess when they come back? Yes Friday 7 July when you go away. 
So now we have an idea. I‘ll come 7 July and when JH arrives back at Haupi from their class trip they will come to your place too to look after puppy and stay till possibly even Monday morning so at least get to see you on your return from the wedding
[22.06.23, 22:14:21] Kathrin Koeller: That stuff was delicious 😋
[22.06.23, 23:39:23] Kochanie Kas: Wonderful! That sounds like a plan ♥️♥️♥️
[22.06.23, 23:39:49] Kochanie Kas: Some lucky ppl!
[27.06.23, 20:49:16] Kathrin Koeller: My dears, this is from somebody whose every muscle is hurting but yesterday I very nearly didn’t go to a new badminton club but at the last minute did. It was soooooo good. I even practiced some new techniques and played in various doubles and they kindly said I had talent and should please come again 😊
But most importantly it was fun and one person summarized it really well: „With no other sport I power myself out and have so much fun at the same time.“ 
Happy Kat agrees. In spite of all these muscles 💪
[28.06.23, 08:22:00] Kochanie Kas: That’s so lovely!!!! That’s the sport fun!!!!! 😅🦾
[28.06.23, 19:36:26] Kathrin Koeller: Only now I think it would be great if there was a sport where I use my left arm more and the right one gets to be the supporting act. 🤔

[07.07.23, 20:45:26] Kathrin Koeller: A young person just smiled at me and said: „Dein Hund ist megaschön.“ 😊
[07.07.23, 21:22:25] David: The person was right :)
[07.07.23, 21:23:57] Kathrin Koeller: I didn‘t tell them it wasn’t mine, just smiled and said thanks. It was so sweet 🥰
[07.07.23, 23:55:19] Kochanie Kas: Oh yes! It’s very sweet when ppl do it 😍 remind us to tell you the Russian spy story 🕵🏼‍♀️🐕
[07.07.23, 23:56:23] Kathrin Koeller: Okay. That sounds interesting.
[07.07.23, 23:56:53] Jh: Um

[08.07.23, 11:14:14] Jh: Looking back on that I should have been able to guess you would call your WiFi that 🤣
[08.07.23, 11:20:12] Kathrin Koeller: I was also under the Impression yesterday that there was a fan but can’t seem to find it 🤔

[08.07.23, 11:36:46] David: Cheers
[08.07.23, 11:37:48] Kathrin Koeller: Have a good day today. Still remember last year very vividly
[08.07.23, 11:38:58] David: Thank you. I’m kinda nervous and in the mood to just chill in a climatized room, but we do what we must so we can do what we want.
[08.07.23, 11:39:39] Kathrin Koeller: Oh I get you!
[08.07.23, 11:39:49] Kathrin Koeller: Wisely spoken

[10.07.23, 12:54:05] David: Yes I think so
[10.07.23, 12:58:54] Jh: Ok can I pick it up on my way back ?
[10.07.23, 12:58:56] Kathrin Koeller: I can only get it tomorrow. So JH, either coordinate with Kasia & David, or buy a new charger at Mediamarkt in Schönhauser Allee. Would be good to have more than one anyway
[10.07.23, 12:59:25] Jh: Never asked you to get it just wondering if you packed it
[10.07.23, 12:59:43] Jh: I think I will be there at around 2  or 2 30

I know you’ll have time to speak with David over the weekend but as we are already almost in August 😫  I just wanted to share some dates when puppy is looking for some sweet company! 
August 10th-14th
August 20th-27th
October 4th-24th

I’m putting it all out there so if #️⃣3️⃣ is doing their superhero duties, we (K&D) can arrange otherwise (as always no problem)!

Hope you are all well, enjoying a bit cooler days!
Lots of love 💗
